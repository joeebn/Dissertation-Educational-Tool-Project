  <h1> Ethics of AI</h1>
  <p>Ethics of AI is complicated and ever changing world. There is no doubt that ethics of AI are a very important consideration for anyone 
    using or developing AI applications. We live in a world where legislation is often behind technology. So ensuring that AI systems
    are built responsibly is paramount to our society.
  </p>

  <p>There are many definitions of what <i>AI ethics is.</i> And it is a fair assessment to make that today's issues may be minor when
  considering what tomorrow's AI can bring. </p>

  <p>If you research online for AI ethics principles you will find many different examples, some with 4, some with 5 main principles.
    For this educational tool we will look at the following:
  <ol>
    <li>Transparency</li>
    <li>Impartiality</li>
    <li>Accountability</li>
    <li>Reliability</li>
    <li>Security & Privacy</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h3>Transparency</h3>
  <p>This first section refers to how the AI systems are used by companies, organisations and governments. As AI becomes more 
    integral to way we work, we should know how these AI systems operate and how they provide the service that they do.
    For example, we should know if an AI system has used our data to provide its service. Moreover, we should be able to remove our data from their models.
    This is laid out in the Data Protection Act. Also, if an AI system is being used to profile us, how do we ensure that it is not biased?

  </p>
  
  <h3>Impartiality</h3>
  <p>AI has the ability to change the world we live in but if not designed properly then issues can arise.
    Impartiality refers to AI being impartial when in use. For example, it should not take physical attributes of person into account, or their
    race, religion, sexual orientation. This is a deeper issue, however the people who design a lot of software are generally males, and generally white.
    How do we ensure that no unconscious bias is embedded into our AI systems?

<h3>Accountability</h3>
<p>This is where who is responsible for an AI system is defined. Whilst we some things, like chatbots, that may not be life threatening, but if self-driving cars 
  become a feature of our society, then the onus is who to control this?
  </p>
  <p>Essentially, we should have a clear hierarchy of responsibility for AI systems. Whether it is the designers and developers or the organisations that use them. 
    There must also be a level of government accountability for this as well. 
  </p>


  <h3>Reliability </h3>
  <p>We need to ensure, like with any software, that AI systems are robust. We cannot afford for some safety-critical applications to fail. Because it has the ability 
    to cause danger to lives, for example, self-driving cars. So when AI systems are developed, they should be robust and thoroughly tested to ensure that there are no 
    issues. We also need to ensure that when issues do arise, which is inevitable when it comes to a digital system, that the accountability takes over. 
  </p>

  <h3>Security & Privacy</h3>
  <p>We have to right to be protected and the right to privacy. So ensuring that AI systems follow these rules is critical. 
    We already have legislation to protect our digital data, Data Protection Act, and we have legislation to protect out privacy, Human Rights Act. 
    As mentioned previously, legislation often falls behind technology as technology develops at a quicker rate. We need to ensure that when developing and 
    using AI system that peoples security and their privacy are not used as collateral for a <i>good AI system.</i>
