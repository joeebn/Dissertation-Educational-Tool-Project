  <h1> Examples of Supervised learning</h1>

  <p>There are many different applications of supervised learning. It is worth looking into how supervised learning is being used, or can be used 
    in your chosen industry. Here are some examples to show you. 
  </p>
<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity is a key part of any computer system nowadays. Protecting digital devices and networks has become big business. AI is also being
  used in this domain to help combat cybercrime. </p>
  <p>As we saw in the unsupervised learning sections, that AI is being used for fraud detection, well the same applies here. Classification
algorithms are being used to analyse if a transaction is fraudulent. </p>
<p> Another way that supervised learning is being used in cybersecurity is through detecting spam emails. Big email providers, such as Microsoft, 
  are investing in systems that classify emails into spam and ham emails.
</p>
<p>Classification is also used in CAPTCHA forms that are readily seen when logging into different systems. For example, a user is asked, as a layer of security 
  to select specific objects. With classification algorithms, this can be done much easily. </p>

<h3>Prediction</h3>
<p>This is a fairly broad area, however, regression analysis is such that most forms of prediction can utilise a supervised learning algorithm.
  As mentioned in the previous section, this is used to predict weather patterns based on historical data, location, time of year and other variables. 
From this, a prediction of weather in the futures can be made. 
</p>
<p>This can also be applied to many other sectors which rely on predictions. One of these is the housing market. If we can share data on different 
  variables of a house, using a regression algorithm, we can get a reliable price. Same for the stock market. If we can measure a certain stock,
  using a regression analysis, we can see if a stock will rise or depreciate. 
</p>

<h3>Image Classification</h3>
<p>We also see image classification as relatively new tool at our disposal. However, the possibilities of this may not yet be fully recognised.
  Image classification is being able to classify images into different categories. Take travel as an example, with image classification, we can 
  use Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to get a cars' number plate, however with classification, we can use this to get the 
  make and model, which could have applications in fighting crime. As well as this, face recognition can be used. Again, this can have applications 
  in cybersecurity and in fighting crime. 
</p>
<p>Image classification has other benefits. If images of skin lesions can be put into a supervised algorithm looking for melanoma, or other conditions, 
  then this could be a very powerful tool at our disposal. The implications this could have could also be major, for example, it could lead to quicker
  diagnosis and reduce waiting times. It could also reduce the workload of medical professionals and others.
