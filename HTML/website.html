  <h1>AI Literacy Tool: Machine Learning</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our AI literacy tool! In this lesson, we will be learning about machine learning, a subfield of AI that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data.</p>

  <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
  <p>Machine learning is a way of teaching computers and machines to learn from data, without programming them. It involves using algorithms to improve their performance on a task by learning from past examples.</p>

  <h2>Types of machine learning</h2>
  <p>There are 3 main types of machine learning. Reinforced learning, Supervised learning, and Unsupervised learning.
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supervised learning</strong> is when a model is trained on labelled data. The correct output is provided for each example in the training set. This allows the model to make predictions on new data</li>

    <li>When we train a model on untrained data, this is called <strong>unsupervised learning</strong>. The trends and patterns in the data will be found out by the model.</li>

    <li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong> involves training a model to make decisions to maximize a reward.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>The type of machine learning used depends on the data and the objectives of the model</p>


  <h2>Applications of machine learning</h2>
  <p>Machine learning is used in some many different parts of modern life. We speak to it through Siri or Alexa, driverless cars use machine learning, it is used for image recognition and for medical diagnoses, to name only a few.</p>
