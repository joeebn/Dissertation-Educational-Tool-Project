  <h1> Examples of Machine learning</h1>
  <p>This section will give an overview of the different ways that machine learning is used in different industries.</p>
  
  <h3>Retail and e-commerce</h3>
  <p>To start we will look at retail and e-commerce. </p>

  <h5>Recommendations</h5>
  <p>One way that machine learning is being used for retail and e-commerce sites is through recommending different products and services
    to users. In the past, marketing in this way would have been a long process. Now, with machine learning algorithms, organisations 
    can look at lots of different data and advertise products based on that. Now, we even see lots of shops offering discounts for using 
    loyalty cards. This is so that pool of data increases and allows these companies to continue to offer products that may suit your needs. 
    Some people like this level of personalisation, others think it is too much. What is your opinion?
  </p>

  <h5>Personalisation</h5>
  <p>This links with recommendations, but now we can have personalised adverts that target us directly based on the machine learning algorithms
    that provide a service. Think about how locations near to you are advertised, or how things you are looking for get advertised to you. 
    For example, if you search for holiday destinations, on different platforms, such as social media and on Google, you are advertised different deals. Coincident?
  
  <h5>Customer Service</h5>
  <p>As mentioned in the reinforced learning section, there are now different chatbots that are becoming commercially available for 
    companies to utilise. This has a big impact on the customer service industry. Customers can noe interface with a chatbot opposed to a 
    human. Some people find this to be a travesty, others believe it is a sign of the times. Nonetheless, this will allow for companies to
    reduce wages on staff and invest in chatbots to resolve customer issues. This will obviously come at a cost. 
  </p>
  </p>

  <h3>Medicine</h3>
  <p>The next industry to look at is the medical industry. There are many different ways that AI and machine learning is impacting on this 
    industry. We have already seen that chatbots are being used in the e-commerce industry, well that same can apply for general practice. 
    If a patient wishes to arrange a consultation, surgeries can utilise chatbot technology to book patients in. 
  </p>
  <h5>Diagnosis Systems</h5>
  <p>This is one aspect of AI that has already been discussed, but diagnosis systems have the potential to offer a lot in the medical industry,
    and in our society. These allow for patterns to be detected, helping diagnose much quicker and efficiently. Ultimately, this can lead to 
    patients getting the help they need much quicker, which is a positive all round. 
  </p>
  <h5>Developing Medicines</h5>
  <p>In the reinforced learning section, we discussed how it is used for making better chemical products. Well this can apply
    to the creation of different medicines by pharmaceutical companies. In theory, this should allow for a "better product", and hopefully
  cheaper overheads allowing for individuals to get affordable medicines, however that remains to be seen! </p>

  <h5>Wearable Technology</h5>
  <p>Wearable technology is another place that machine learning has become popular. People can wear smart watches with the ability 
      to monitor heart beats, blood levels etc. There have been examples where these devices has pre-warned about potential health issues
      based on pattern detection, which is a key part of machine learning. 
  </p>


  <h3>Manufacturing and Engineering</h3>
  <p>In this section we will look at how machine learning is being used in the engineering and manufacturing industries.</p>

  <h5>Robotics</h5>
  <p>Robotics has the potential to change the manufacturing industry in many ways. Like with most of the examples given, there are ethical
    implications of this, one of them being job loss, but robotics will be able to create and manufacture products quicker, more efficiently,
    and safer than humans can. There may even be a day where home robotics is used to perform remedial tasks, such as household chores. 
  </p>

  <h5>Quality Control</h5>
  <p>Another key aspect of the manufacturing process in the quality control. Image recognition is a big part of machine learning. 
    If image recognition could be used in the quality control phase of manufacturing then this could see improvements in the supply chain. 
    Image recognition is where algorithms are used process images and then can be used for different purposes, for example, classification. 
    In this case, images could be taken of products and a computer could pass or fail based on the classification benchmarks that have been set. 
  
  </p>

  <h5>Modelling</h5>
  <p>A key part of engineering is modelling the world around us to ensure a product can work in the environment it is intended to be in. 
    Reinforcement learning has the ability to do this. In the reinforced learning section, an example was given about a bridge being build. 
    Machine learning could be used to ensure that these sort of projects are built to handle to world around them and to be built safely. 
    Whilst many countries have safety checks on engineering projects, recent earthquakes in Turkey and Syria have shown that not all 
    buildings are constructed safely, could machine learning be used to help redesign these in the future?
  </p>

  <h3>Cybersecurity and Legal sector</h3>
  <p>In this section we will look at how AI and machine learning is being used in the cybersecurity and legal sectors</p>

  <h5>Cybersecurity</h5>
  <p>One way that cybersecurity is being improve with machine learning is in malware detection. Unfortunately, malware is a big part
    of cybersecurity nowadays, but machine learning is being deployed by many companies to protect against this issue. For example, machine learning 
    can be used to find code in malware that allows for better security.
  </p>

  <p> Another place that we see machine learning being used to improve cybersecurity is through analysing when cyberattacks may take place. 
    Systems have been developed that will spot patterns in cybersecurity attacks and allow for organisations to make provisions. </p>


  <h5>Fraud</h5>
    <p>As mentioned a few times throughout this educational tool, AI and machine learning has the ability to spot patterns and anomalies
      in data at a quick rate. When applied to the legal industry, it has the ability to stop some fraudulent activity. </p>
  
  
  
  <h3>Creative Industries</h3>

  <h5> Gaming</h5>
  <p>Like many other industries, AI is playing a role in the gaming industry. Machine learning is allowing developers to scale up their
    production of games, for example, using AI to make game maps bigger and better than before. They can also use AI to develop more challenge. 
    For example, like we saw in the reinforcements learning section, we can program computers to the game environment, which could add more
    challenge into the game.  
  </p>

  <h5>Image and Video Creation</h5>
  <p>Image and video creation is another way that AI is  being used in the creative industry. Deepfake technology, whilst posing an ethical risk,
    also provides film and TV directors the ability to have different characters appear with relative ease. 
  </p>
  <p>We are also seeing a rise in image creation through the use of AI. For example, you type in what you want and the AI algorithm designs
    a unique piece of art. This can then be used in many different settings. 
  </p>

  <h5>Social Media</h5>
  <p>Social media is has become another industry where AI is used. For example, chatbots can be used for the messaging service, allowing companies
    to spend less time monitoring messages. We are also seeing image recognition being used in many different social media platforms. This
    allows for personalisation and can allow for social media companies to target adverts at their users.
  </p>

  <p>There are so many different ways that industries are using and will use AI and machine learning.
