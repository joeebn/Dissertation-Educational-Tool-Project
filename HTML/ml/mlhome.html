  <h1> Home of Machine Learning</h1>

  <p>So far we have looked at different ways that AI can be used and have looked at 3 different models for AI. 
    Machine Learning is a subbranch of AI. All of the methods: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning, all use machine learning 
    in one way or another. This section aims to look at how machine learning is being used in different industries and the effect these have on
    those industries. The aim is that you are then equipped with the knowledge and understanding of how machine learning fits, or could fit, 
    into your chosen field. 
  </p>

  <p>Remember, machine learning is when a machine has the ability to learn without being programmed to do so. So, the way the program learns 
    is designed by a developer, but the program uses the data it receives and uses that to improve the algorithm by itself.
