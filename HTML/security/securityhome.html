  <h1> AI security</h1>

  <p>This was touched upon in the ethics section, but deserves to be discussed on its own. In this section we will look at the security aspect 
    of AI in all its forms. 
    We will look at two different aspects of AI security:
    <ul>
      <li>First we will look at <strong>AI Protection.</strong>- This is the ways in which AI can protect us and improve our security.</li>
      <li>The second aspect is <strong>AI Governance.</strong>- This is the potential threats that AI can cause to our security. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>AI Protection</h3>
  <p>We have look numerous times in this educational tool at how AI is being used to combat cybersecurity and for other legal issues, such as fraud.
    These are important practices that AI will allow us to have a safer experience online. For more computer literate users, computer security may 
    not be a massive issues as it is ingrained in us already, however not less literate users, this will allow for better protection.
  
  </p>
  <p>We may also see improvements in other aspects of cybersecurity, for example, online bullying, harassment and exploitation.
    If AI continues to be used for classification, then social media providers can use this technology to safeguard against these issues.
    Again, this leads to safer online world at the hands of AI. 

  </p>

  <p>There are other AI protection that we need to discuss as well. Physical protection. AI has the potential to be used in expert systems 
    that can protect and save lives. This is just another application of AI security that we need to consider. 
  
  </p>

  <h3>AI Governance</h3>
  <p>AI has the potential to save lives and protect, but we need to consider the security of our private data when it comes to AI security.
  AI development must link with different organisations to ensure that data is kept secure and not used above its means. We have organisations 
  such as the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) in the UK to protect against misuse of data. However, as AI is a global phenomenon, then
  a global approach must be needed. 
  </p>

  <p>This article provides a great overview of different AI Governance considerations and has some useful case studies <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/privacy-and-responsible-ai/">https://iapp.org/news/a/privacy-and-responsible-ai/</a></p>
