  <h1> Applications of AI</h1>
  <p> AI is fast becoming a technology that is used in so many different sectors.
  Industries are adopting AI as it can be more powerful than humans and can perform tasks in
  a more efficient and much quicker time.</p>
<br>
<p> Here we will look at how AI is changing just a few industries and why.</p>
<br>
<h3> Creative Industries</h3>
<p> The creative industries includes many different forms of media, from film to music.</p>
<p> We see AI being utilised in films for many years. Albeit in a primitive way in the past. 
But now with technology like Deepfakes, any actor can appear on smartphone, and the big 
screen as well. Watch this video to find out more.</p>
<iframe width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLoI9hAX9dw" title="Itâ€™s Getting Harder to Spot a Deep Fake Video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<p> There are other aspects of the creative world that are utilising AI, such as image generation</p>

<p> AI image generation is a new phenomenon whereby users can type into a search bar and an 
image matching that criteria is generated. 
<table >
		<tr>
			<td> <img src="search.png" height = 100 width=450 > </td>
			<td> <img src="arrow.png" height = 100></td>
			<td><img src="results.png"> </td>
		</tr>
</table>
<p> Here you can see and example of an image generated from AI using the DALL-E 2 platform. 
You can try this for yourself at <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2"> DALL-E 2</p></a>
<br>
<p> There are many other ways that AI is used in the creative industries. Why not try looking into some examples online.</p>
<br>
<h3> E-Commerce </h3>
<p> There are many examples of where AI is ued in E-Commerce. First we can see recommendations 
for different products and services based on a users preferences. Here is an example of 
how a recommendation system works. 
<br>
<img src = "recommendation.png">
<center><blockquote> Ferreira et al.(2020) </blockquote></center>
<p> In this image you can see how based on a users' preferences they are given recommendations
on what to buy, listen to, watch and many different areas of e-commerce. </p>
<br>
<p> Another way that e-commerce is affected by AI is through the use of Chatbots. Chatbots
are becoming a very popular way of interfacing with users. They are seen on a lot of e-commerce 
websites because they can handle basic responses, and now, maybe some more complex ones. 
It's interesting to think about how far chatbots will go! </p>
<br>
<p> Watch this video on the raise of one of the most popular Chatbots on the market currently,<a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt"> Chat GPT</a></p>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<p>Healthcare is the final industry we will look at in this section. AI is now being used as part of the
diagnosis process for different medical issues. AI has the ability to look through images and find 
potential cancers or be given different symptoms and feed this back to a doctor. We also see big
data used in drug trials to see if a drug is successful or not. </p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Here you can see an image showing how AI is used to detect brain tumors. The model is given
examples that is learns from to give a potential prognosis. </p>
