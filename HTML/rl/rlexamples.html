  <h1> Examples of Reinforced learning</h1>
  <p> Like with the other forms of AI, there are many different ways that reinforced learning is used in the world around us. 
    This section will look at just some of the different industries and ways that reinforcement learning is applied. 
  </p>

  <h3>Emerging technologies</h3>
  <p>This may seem as a broad industry, however there is a lot of research and application of reinforcement learning in this field. 
    First, self-driving cars are becoming a new technology that some countries have started to implement. These allow for cars to be driven 
    automatically, rather than controlled by a user. Well in order for this to happen, the car must learn from the environment around it. 
    In this case, the algorithm controlling the car takes in data from its surroundings, such as roads, other road users, pedestrians etc. 
    and form this it is able to drive safely in the environnement. The cars have gone through rigorous development and testing to get to this point. 

  </p>

  <p>Another technology to consider is the robotics industry. Very similar to self-driving cars, robotics, if their are to become autonomous, or at least perceived 
    as autonomous, then they too need to learn from their surroundings to perform the tasks expected of them. The use of robotics is becoming
    very big in the world of manufacturing. The effects that well designed robotics can have of production allows for quicker and more efficient
    production process.

  <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
  <p>This is one of the ways that reinforced learning is being utilised. Many different applications use natural-language processing (NLP) for 
    various tasks. For example, most people now have a phone with the ability to talk to, like Siri or Alexa. These utilise NLP to work.
    What happen is that the applications are trained and interact with the environment around them which allow users to have a personal assistant.
    This will only improve, in the past this technology was limited to mearly playing songs or performing basic tasks. Now we can use this 
    to perform most functionality that our devices are capable of. This is good for accessibility issues and, as NLP can use a voice, it can utilise
    biometrics, making it secure. 
  </p>

  <p>NLP interfaces are not always voice controlled. Another way that NLP is used with reinforced learning is through Chatbots.
    Chatbots have really taken off in the past couple of years and now we are seeing the rise of applications such as ChatGPT. 
    This specific chatbot is making grounds as one of the first mass-used chatbot services. ChatGPT, and the plethora of others in development,
    are using reinforced learning to allow us to interface with the chatbot. In industry, this could mean that a lot of customer service is doen through 
    chatbots. It could also see a rise in most e-commerce websites. In the case of ChatGPT, they use reinforced learning based on human feedback, whilst also
    using supervised learning to train the initial model.

  <h3>Science</h3>
  <p>We are also seeing benefits of reinforced learning in the science sector as well. Again, this is obviously very broad but I would like to share 
    a few examples of how AI is  being used. First, reinforced learning can be used to model the world around use. This could be beneficial 
    in the engineering industry. If an engineer had to model, for example, if a bridge was safe, now, with a well designed reinforced learning model, 
    the engineer could check that bridge was safe for different conditions. This could then be applied to different contexts.

  <p>Tech Vidvan also say that reinforcement learning can be used in atomic science. For example, if a scientist were to combine different 
    chemicals together, reinforcement learning can allow for "cleaner reactions that yield better products". (Tech Vidvan, No Date)
