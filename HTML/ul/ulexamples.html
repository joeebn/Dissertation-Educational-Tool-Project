  <h1> Examples of Unsupervised learning</h1>

  <p>Like most other AI models, unsupervised learning has many different applications that are currently being used across different industries.</p>
  
  <h3> Recommendation Systems</h3>
  <p>In the previous section we saw that unsupervised learning is used in recommendation systems across streaming platforms. That is to say that the platform finds links
between viewing habits and what others are watching to give recommendations. A similar principle applies to e-commerce. 
An unsupervised model can look at what other people bought based on purchasing history, from this, they can recommend different products 
that might suit the needs of the user.</p>

<h3>Medical Diagnosis</h3>
<p> We have also seen that medical diagnosis systems use a similar system. A user can input their symptoms, from this and historical data, the 
  model can give a prognosis. This is in its infancy, however it will be interesting to see how this developes in the future. 
</p>

<h3>Detection Systems</h3>
<p>One of the main applications of unsupervised learning is that it can be used to look for outliers and anomalies in datasets. 
  This has many real-world applications for us as users of AI. First banks can use this to look at fraud. If a model has been trained to 
  look for anomalies, when a transaction, or series of transactions, breaks this trend, then banks can stop them straight away. 
  This has the potential to save a lot of money in the long term. 
</p>
<p>The same principle can apply to insurance companies. Such as with banks, insurance brokers can use this to analyse trends in 
  insurance scams and use this to protect themselves and their customers from fraud. 
</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>Marketing, and having a competitive edge is such a crucial part of business. Businesses utilisiing unsupervised learning are improving
  their marketing. As mentioned, e-commerce sites can use unsupervised learning to look for trends and advertise based on the purchasing history.
  This can then be used by companies for many different purposes, whether it's to advertise products online, change the layout of a physical store, 
  alter prices to suit their customers needs, and many other examples.

<p>As with all AI learning models, there are many applications and much more science behind the models.
